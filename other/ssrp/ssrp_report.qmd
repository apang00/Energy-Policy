During our analysis, we reproduced three figures of interest from "Energy Saving May Kill: Evidence from the Fukushima Nuclear Accident" by He and Tanaka (2019). As highlighted in our data section, we were particularly interested in the variables domestic energy consumption, price, nuclear production. Thus we chose to reproduce the figures 1A, 1B, and G1. 

All reproductions were done using R and tidyverse. 

Reproduction 1 : Figure1A

Reproduction 2 : Figure1B
